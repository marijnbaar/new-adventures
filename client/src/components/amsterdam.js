      <p>Life is unpredictable. And that’s okay. Embrace it.
When nothing is certain, everything is possible!
Your plans for tomorrow, next month or next year may not unfold as you expect. But it’s important to make plans and move on.
Landon Donovan once said, “Life isn’t perfect, of course, but we all know it’s how you react to things that counts.”
Imperfection is the basic principle of Wabi-Sabi, the Japanese philosophy of accepting your imperfections and making the most of life.
“Wabi” is said to be defined as “rustic simplicity” or “understated elegance” with a focus on a less-is-more mentality.
“Sabi” is translated to “taking pleasure in the imperfect.”
The concept of wabi-sabi, is wide and almost impossible to distill in a single post, but can easily be applied simply to moments of everyday life.
The relentless pursuit of perfection — in possessions, relationships, achievements — often leads to stress, anxiety, depression and hasty judgement.</p></div>
