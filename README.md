# New Adventures
Discover hidden gems per city. Where to walk, sleep, eat and play.


Create an app in one day, as part of the </salt> full stack javascript bootcamp. Ready, set, code!

# Requirements

Implement a front-end with React, and implement a back-end, for which I will use express and a database that I create myself, that stores data in a json object. 
Passes the relevent information about the best hotspots in Dutch city's, for a fun, safe and corona-proof holiday in Holland. 

# My app
In the app users can select a holiday destination in Holland (my database has a list of different city's) and then they will be provided with a list of hotspots that can be visited in, or in the vacinity of that city. 

# Preperations

- Create a single page application with React. 
- Set up the Express server to fetch data.
- Create a database with several cities and a hotspot list.
- Have a dropdown menu from which the user can select a city.
- If city is selected, display all the different hotspots in that city.

# Design
Keep it clean and simple. Nice colours, maybe a subtle gradient and a nature-like look and feel, that will make you want to embark upon new adventures.
